    # These next lines define a docker executor: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/executor-types/
    # You can specify an image from Dockerhub or use one of our Convenience Images from CircleCI's Developer Hub.

    # Then run your tests!
    # CircleCI will report the results back to your VCS provider.
    steps:
      # Checkout the code as the first step.
      - checkout
      # Next, the node orb's install-packages step will install the dependencies from a package.json.
      # The orb install-packages step will also automatically cache them for faster future runs.

workflows:

  # Inside the workflow, you provide the jobs you want to run, e.g this workflow runs the build-and-test job above.
  # CircleCI will run this workflow on every commit.

  sample:
    jobs:

          command: yarn run test:e2e --headless
          yarn: true
      # For running simple node tests, you could optionally instead use the node/test job from the orb to replicate and replace the manually defined "test" job above in fewer lines.
      # - node/test
